            <li>Strategic intent and goals.</li>
            <li>Research and data analysis to identify rank expansion opportunities.</li>
            <li>Identification of channels, competitor profiles, logistics, fiscal structures – and in some cases, the actual business practice –the regulatory environment, barriers to entry, marketing standards, resources and practices, tax and pricing models, legal requirements and options, consumer profiles, and the actual operation of different channels.<p/></li>
            <li>In person market visits to understand the environment, challenge assumptions, seek inspiration, assess risk and cultural challenges, commence in market networking and support development, verify understanding and meet industry players, officials and potential partners.</li>
            <li>Careful selection and use of trade shows as part of a pro-active market penetration plan and timeline.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with trade associations, chambers of commerce, officials, industry and general contacts of the US and host country.</li>
            <li>Review, test and rework local import cost and tax structures to understand and develop a full price structure down to retail.</li>
            <li>Extensive vetting process, relationship building and discovery process for all new partners; be unafraid to move away from the easy or comfortable choice...or to wait for the optimal fit.</li>
            <li>Revisit discovery results and verify again the understanding; visit facilities, speak across levels of an organization, invest in relationships.</li>
            <li>Plan legal support and contract negotiation tactics, working closely with legal representation. This is the first step in renegotiating a contract or restructuring an existing distributor.</li>
            <li>Build in transition process and time, take time and adopt patience in order to get it right. Be thorough until your organization’s understanding of the new market is embedded.</li>
            <li>Establish comprehensive but practical reporting systems; deliver interactive feedback with the export market management and functional teams. Build the relationship.</li>
            <li>Get compliance right and consider broader impacts and implications of local initiatives, especially around pricing and terms.</li>
            <li>Get the digital sales and marketing plan adapted and reflective of the international expansion of the brand footprint.</li>
            <li>Treat the local partner/management as an extension of the Head Office team and build, invest in the relationship.</li>
